# Using Selenium for Browser Control in Python

This repository contains three Python scripts designed for browser automation using Selenium WebDriver.

## Scripts Description

- `task1.py`: Navigates to eBay, accepts cookies, selects the Electronics category, and performs a search for "Laptop Charger HP".
- `task2.py`: Utilizes an online SHA256 hashing tool to input and hash "Sample text".
- `test3.py`: Automates the process of changing from SHA256 to SHA224 hashing and ensures the input field is present on the screen.

Each script is standalone and demonstrates different capabilities of browser automation with Selenium.

## Setup and Execution

Before running the scripts, ensure you have the Selenium package installed and the Chrome WebDriver configured on your system.

1. Install Selenium:
   ```
   pip install selenium
   ```
2. Download and set up Chrome WebDriver: [Link to WebDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/)

To run a script, simply execute:
```
python <script_name>.py
```
